# Deploy Capability Agents

You are guiding the user through extending their voice agent with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) capability agents. This is optional — the voice agent works without them, but they add powerful features.

## When This Skill Activates
- User says "deploy agents", "add KB", "add CRM", "add appointment", "capability agents"
- User finished `/configure-daily` and wants to extend the agent
- User asks about knowledge base, RAG, customer lookup, appointments, scheduling, or A2A

## Prerequisites

The core deployment must be complete:
- `/deploy-cloud-api` or `/deploy-sagemaker` has been run
- `/configure-daily` has been run (phone number active)
- The user has tested the basic agent (time check, hangup)

## What's Running Now

Before deploying anything, set context for the user:

```
Current voice agent capabilities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  • Natural conversation — powered by Claude on Bedrock
  • get_current_time    — "What time is it?"
  • hangup_call         — "Goodbye" / ask to end the call

Tool calling is enabled by default. The agent can hold conversations
and use the two built-in tools above. No other tools are active yet.
```

## How Capability Agents Work

Explain the architecture before deploying:

```
A2A Architecture:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Voice Agent   │
                    │   (ECS hub)     │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │ polls every 30s
                    ┌────────▼────────┐
                    │    CloudMap     │
                    │  (discovery)    │
                    └──┬─────┬─────┬──┘
                       │     │     │
              ┌────────▼─┐ ┌─▼────────┐ ┌▼───────────┐
              │ KB Agent  │ │CRM Agent │ │Appointment │
              │(ECS spoke)│ │(ECS spoke)│ │  Agent     │
              └───────────┘ └──────────┘ └────────────┘
```

Key points:
- Each capability agent runs as a **separate ECS container** (its own task definition, scaling, and logs)
- Agents register themselves in **CloudMap** under a shared namespace
- The voice agent **polls CloudMap every 30 seconds** for new agents
- When discovered, the agent's skills are **automatically registered as LLM tools** — no pipeline code changes needed
- If an agent goes away, its tools are automatically deregistered after a grace period

## What To Do

### Phase 1: Check Current State

Verify the core deployment is healthy and check whether agents are already deployed:

```bash
# Core health
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/ecs/cluster-arn" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null

# Capability registry status
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/config/enable-capability-registry" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-set (defaults to false)"

# Agent stacks
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name VoiceAgentKbAgent --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-deployed"
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name VoiceAgentCrmAgent --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-deployed"
```

### Phase 2: Choose Agents

Present the available agents and let the user choose:

| Agent | What It Does | Stacks Deployed | Test Prompt |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Base** | RAG search over documents in `resources/` (troubleshooting guides, service info, policies) | `VoiceAgentKnowledgeBase` + `VoiceAgentKbAgent` | "My printer keeps disconnecting from the network" |
| **CRM** | Customer lookup, case creation, case updates via DynamoDB | `VoiceAgentCRM` + `VoiceAgentCrmAgent` | "Can you look up my account? My number is 555-0100" |
| **Appointment** | Appointment scheduling, availability checks, booking/cancellation | `VoiceAgentAppointment` + `VoiceAgentAppointmentAgent` | "I need to schedule an on-site repair" |

Ask: "Which agents would you like to deploy? You can deploy one, some, or all three."

### Phase 3: Enable the Capability Registry

This is required **once** before deploying any agents. Skip if already enabled.

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name "/voice-agent/config/enable-capability-registry" \
  --value "true" --type String --overwrite
```

The voice agent reads this flag at the start of each call. No container restart is needed — the next incoming call will start the CloudMap polling loop.

### Phase 4: Deploy Selected Agents

**Get confirmation before deploying.** Show the account ID and region.

> **Reminder:** If you deployed the core infrastructure with `USE_CLOUD_APIS=true`, you must set it for capability agent deploys too. This ensures the SageMaker stub stack is used when CDK resolves dependencies:
> ```bash
> export USE_CLOUD_APIS=true
> export CDK_DOCKER=finch  # or 'docker'
> ```

#### Knowledge Base Agent

```bash
npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentKnowledgeBase VoiceAgentKbAgent --require-approval never
```

This deploys:
- **VoiceAgentKnowledgeBase** — Bedrock Knowledge Base + S3 bucket with sample documents from `resources/`
- **VoiceAgentKbAgent** — ECS Fargate container that exposes a `search_knowledge_base` skill via A2A

Takes ~5-8 minutes. The KB agent uses a direct tool executor (bypasses inner LLM) for low-latency queries (~300ms).

#### CRM Agent

```bash
npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentCRM VoiceAgentCrmAgent --require-approval never
```

This deploys:
- **VoiceAgentCRM** — DynamoDB tables (empty) + CRM API Lambda for customers and cases
- **VoiceAgentCrmAgent** — ECS Fargate container that exposes 5 CRM tools via A2A (customer lookup, case creation, case update, case listing, case detail)

Takes ~5-8 minutes.

**Seed the CRM with demo data** — the DynamoDB tables are created empty. The CRM API has a `/admin/seed` endpoint that loads demo customers and cases:

```bash
CRM_URL=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/crm/api-url" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)
curl -s -X POST "$CRM_URL/admin/seed" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected response: `{"message": "Demo data seeded successfully", "customers_seeded": 3, "cases_seeded": 2}`

The seed data includes:

| Customer | Phone | Account Type | Test Prompt |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| John Smith | 555-0100 | premium | "Look up the account for 555-0100" |
| Sarah Johnson | 555-0101 | basic | "Can you find Sarah Johnson?" |
| Michael Chen | 555-0102 | enterprise | "Look up customer 555-0102" |

There are also 2 demo support cases (a billing dispute for John Smith and a service outage for Michael Chen).

> **Without seeding, all CRM lookups return "customer not found."** This step is required for testing.

To reset and re-seed later: `DELETE /admin/reset` followed by `POST /admin/seed`.

#### Appointment Agent

```bash
npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentAppointment VoiceAgentAppointmentAgent --require-approval never
```

This deploys:
- **VoiceAgentAppointment** — DynamoDB table + Appointment API Lambda with 5 service types and scheduling logic
- **VoiceAgentAppointmentAgent** — ECS Fargate container that exposes 5 appointment tools via A2A (check availability, book, get, cancel, reschedule)

Takes ~5-8 minutes.

**Seed the Appointment system with demo data** — the DynamoDB table is created empty. The Appointment API has a `/admin/seed` endpoint:

```bash
APPT_URL=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/appointments/api-url" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)
curl -s -X POST "$APPT_URL/admin/seed" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected response: `{"message": "Demo data seeded successfully", "appointments_seeded": 6}`

The seed data includes 5 service types and 6 sample appointments for the same customers as the CRM:

| Service Type | Duration | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| on_site_repair | 2 hours | On-site hardware/network repair |
| network_setup | 3 hours | Network installation and configuration |
| hardware_upgrade | 2 hours | Hardware component upgrades |
| general_consultation | 1 hour | General IT consultation |
| preventive_maintenance | 2 hours | Preventive maintenance visit |

> **Without seeding, availability checks work but customer appointment history is empty.** Seed both CRM and Appointment for the full demo experience.

To reset and re-seed later: `DELETE /admin/reset` followed by `POST /admin/seed`.

### Phase 5: Verify Agent Discovery

After deployment, wait ~1 minute for the agents to register in CloudMap and be discovered. Then verify:

```bash
# Check CloudMap namespace for registered services
NAMESPACE=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/ecs/cloudmap-namespace" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$NAMESPACE" ]; then
  NAMESPACE_ID=$(aws servicediscovery list-namespaces --query "Namespaces[?Name=='$NAMESPACE'].Id" --output text)
  aws servicediscovery list-services --filters "Name=NAMESPACE_ID,Values=$NAMESPACE_ID,Condition=EQ" \
    --query 'Services[].Name' --output text
fi
```

You should see the agent service names listed. The voice agent will discover them on the next CloudMap poll (within 30 seconds).

### Phase 6: Test

Prompt the user to make a test call:

```
Capability agents deployed:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  [status] Knowledge Base — "My printer keeps disconnecting from the network"
  [status] CRM           — "Look up the account for 555-0100"
  [status] Appointment   — "I need to schedule an on-site repair"

Call [phone number] and try one of the prompts above.
The voice agent discovers new agents automatically — no restart needed.
```

If the CRM agent was deployed, confirm the seed data is loaded:
```bash
CRM_URL=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/crm/api-url" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)
curl -s "$CRM_URL/customers" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
if not data:
    print('WARNING: No customers found. Run POST /admin/seed to load demo data.')
else:
    print(f'{len(data)} customer(s) loaded:')
    for c in data:
        print(f'  {c.get(\"name\", \"?\")} — {c.get(\"phone\", \"?\")}')
"
```

If the Appointment agent was deployed, confirm seed data:
```bash
APPT_URL=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/appointments/api-url" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)
curl -s "$APPT_URL/service-types" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
if not data:
    print('WARNING: No service types found. Run POST /admin/seed to load demo data.')
else:
    print(f'{len(data)} service type(s) loaded:')
    for s in data:
        print(f'  {s.get(\"service_type\", \"?\")} — {s.get(\"name\", \"?\")}')
"
```

If a tool isn't responding on the first call, remind the user:
- The registry polls every 30 seconds — wait a moment and try again
- Check ECS console to confirm the agent container is running and healthy
- Check CloudWatch logs for the agent container if it's not registering

### Phase 7: Report

```
Capability Agent Deployment Complete:
✅ Capability registry enabled
[status] Knowledge Base agent — deployed / skipped
[status] CRM agent — deployed / skipped
[status] Appointment agent — deployed / skipped
✅ Agents discoverable via CloudMap

Your voice agent now has [N] additional tools available.
Run /verify-deployment to confirm full system health.
```

Remind user to use the **destroy-project** skill to tear down all resources when done.
