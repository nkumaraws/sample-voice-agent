# Deploy — SageMaker Mode

You are guiding the user through deploying the voice agent with self-hosted Deepgram STT/TTS on SageMaker GPU endpoints. Audio never leaves the VPC.

## When This Skill Activates
- User wants a production deployment
- User mentions SageMaker, self-hosted, data residency, or VPC-only
- User has already subscribed to Deepgram on AWS Marketplace

## What To Do

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks

Run the same checks as deploy-cloud-api (AWS credentials, Node.js, Docker, Bedrock access) and additionally:

1. **Confirm account:**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
   Show account ID and region. **Get explicit confirmation this is the right account.**

2. **Check SageMaker GPU quotas:**
   ```bash
   aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code sagemaker --quota-code "L-1B43B3DD" --query 'Quota.Value' --output text
   aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code sagemaker --quota-code "L-E460AE79" --query 'Quota.Value' --output text
   ```
   - STT needs `ml.g6.2xlarge` quota >= 2
   - TTS needs `ml.g6.12xlarge` quota >= 2
   - If insufficient: suggest deploying cloud API mode first while quotas are pending (24-48 hours)

Report all results as a summary checklist.

### Phase 2: Verify Marketplace Subscriptions

Ask for two model package ARNs. If the user doesn't have them, direct them to `docs/reference/deepgram-marketplace-setup.md`.

Expected format:
- STT: `arn:aws:sagemaker:<region>:865070037744:model-package/deepgram-streaming-stt-...`
- TTS: `arn:aws:sagemaker:<region>:865070037744:model-package/deepgram-streaming-tts-...`

Validate: both must start with `arn:aws:sagemaker:` and contain `model-package/`. Region must match deployment region.

### Phase 3: Configure Environment

```bash
cd infrastructure && cp .env.example .env
```

Set model package ARNs in `.env`. Region in the ARNs must match `AWS_REGION`.

### Phase 4: Explain What Will Be Created

Same resources as cloud-api mode, plus:

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| SageMaker STT (ml.g6.2xlarge) | Deepgram Nova-3 on 1x L4 GPU |
| SageMaker TTS (ml.g6.12xlarge) | Deepgram Aura on 4x L4 GPU |

Deployment takes 20-25 minutes (SageMaker endpoints ~15 min).

> **Cost responsibility:** The user is responsible for all AWS charges incurred by these resources. SageMaker GPU endpoints incur charges while running. Remind them to use the **destroy-project** skill to tear down resources when done.

**Get explicit confirmation before deploying.**

### Phase 5: Deploy Foundation + Configure Secrets + Deploy Remaining

Deploy in two stages so the ECS container picks up the Daily API key on first boot.

> **Important:** Do **not** set `USE_CLOUD_APIS=true` for SageMaker mode. That flag deploys a lightweight stub instead of real GPU endpoints. In SageMaker mode, the real `SageMakerStack` is used, which requires valid Deepgram Marketplace model package ARNs configured in Phase 3.

1. **Install and bootstrap:**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure && npm install
   ```
   Check if CDK is bootstrapped; if not, run `npx cdk bootstrap`.

2. **Set container build tool** (must be set in every terminal session):
   ```bash
   export CDK_DOCKER=finch  # or 'docker' if using Docker Desktop
   ```

3. **Deploy foundation stacks (Network + Storage):**
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentNetwork VoiceAgentStorage --require-approval never
   ```

4. **Configure secrets now, before deploying ECS:**
   SageMaker mode only needs `DAILY_API_KEY` (no Deepgram/Cartesia cloud keys).
   Write to `backend/voice-agent/.env`, then push:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init-secrets.sh
   ```

5. **Deploy remaining stacks (SageMaker + ECS + BotRunner):**
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentSageMaker VoiceAgentEcs VoiceAgentBotRunner --require-approval never
   ```
   SageMaker endpoints take 10-15 minutes to provision. This is normal.
   - **ResourceLimitExceeded** = GPU quota insufficient
   - **Model package not found** = wrong ARN or region mismatch
   - **"ModelPackage does not exist"** = the placeholder ARNs were not replaced with real Marketplace ARNs in Phase 3. Go back and set `DEEPGRAM_STT_MODEL_PACKAGE_ARN` and `DEEPGRAM_TTS_MODEL_PACKAGE_ARN` in your `.env` file.

### Phase 6: Verify SageMaker Endpoints

```bash
STT_ENDPOINT=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/sagemaker/stt-endpoint-name" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)
TTS_ENDPOINT=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/sagemaker/tts-endpoint-name" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)

aws sagemaker describe-endpoint --endpoint-name "$STT_ENDPOINT" --query 'EndpointStatus' --output text
aws sagemaker describe-endpoint --endpoint-name "$TTS_ENDPOINT" --query 'EndpointStatus' --output text
```

Both should show "InService". If "Creating", wait and recheck.

### Phase 7: Show Progress and Next Steps

Same as deploy-cloud-api Phase 7 -- show progress checklist, direct to configure-daily. Remind user to use the **destroy-project** skill when done to release Daily phone numbers and tear down all AWS resources.
