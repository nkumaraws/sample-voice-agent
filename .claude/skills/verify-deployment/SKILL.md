# Verify — Is Everything Working?

You are running a comprehensive health check against the deployed voice agent infrastructure. Your job is to test every component, explain results clearly, and help the user fix any issues.

## When This Skill Activates
- User says "verify", "check deployment", "is everything working?"
- User just finished deploying and wants to confirm
- User is having issues and wants to diagnose
- User starts a new session and has an existing deployment

## What To Do

### Phase 1: Discover Deployment State

"Let me check your deployment. I'll test each component and report what I find."

Run all checks and collect results before presenting them:

1. **SSM Parameters** (proves stacks deployed):
   ```bash
   for param in \
     "/voice-agent/network/vpc-id" \
     "/voice-agent/storage/api-key-secret-arn" \
     "/voice-agent/sagemaker/stt-endpoint-name" \
     "/voice-agent/sagemaker/tts-endpoint-name" \
     "/voice-agent/ecs/cluster-arn" \
     "/voice-agent/ecs/service-endpoint" \
     "/voice-agent/botrunner/webhook-url"; do
     VALUE=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "$param" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
     if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "OK|$param|${VALUE:0:60}"
     else
       echo "MISSING|$param|"
     fi
   done
   ```

2. **ECS Service health:**
   ```bash
   CLUSTER=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/ecs/cluster-arn" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -n "$CLUSTER" ]; then
     SERVICE_ARN=$(aws ecs list-services --cluster "$CLUSTER" --query 'serviceArns[0]' --output text 2>/dev/null)
     aws ecs describe-services --cluster "$CLUSTER" --services "$SERVICE_ARN" \
       --query 'services[0].{Status:status,Running:runningCount,Desired:desiredCount,Pending:pendingCount}' --output json 2>/dev/null
   fi
   ```

3. **Secrets populated:**
   ```bash
   SECRET_ARN=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/storage/api-key-secret-arn" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -n "$SECRET_ARN" ]; then
     aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "$SECRET_ARN" --query 'SecretString' --output text 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
   import json, sys
   try:
     secret = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
     for key in ['DAILY_API_KEY', 'DEEPGRAM_API_KEY', 'CARTESIA_API_KEY']:
       val = secret.get(key, '')
       if not val or 'PLACEHOLDER' in val:
         print(f'MISSING|{key}')
       else:
         print(f'OK|{key}|{len(val)} chars')
   except: print('ERROR|Could not parse secrets')
   "
   fi
   ```

4. **Webhook endpoint:**
   ```bash
   WEBHOOK_URL=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/botrunner/webhook-url" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -n "$WEBHOOK_URL" ]; then
     HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"type": "dialin.connected", "callId": "health-check", "callDomain": "test.daily.co"}' 2>/dev/null)
     echo "WEBHOOK|$HTTP_CODE|$WEBHOOK_URL"
   fi
   ```

5. **Deployment mode + SageMaker (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   STT_ENDPOINT=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/sagemaker/stt-endpoint-name" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
   if [[ "$STT_ENDPOINT" == *"cloud-api-mode"* ]]; then
     echo "MODE|cloud-api"
   else
     echo "MODE|sagemaker"
     aws sagemaker describe-endpoint --endpoint-name "$STT_ENDPOINT" --query 'EndpointStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null
     TTS_ENDPOINT=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/sagemaker/tts-endpoint-name" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null)
     aws sagemaker describe-endpoint --endpoint-name "$TTS_ENDPOINT" --query 'EndpointStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null
   fi
   ```

### Phase 2: Present Results

Show a clear, visual summary:

```
Voice Agent Health Check
========================

Infrastructure:
  ✅ VPC and networking — deployed
  ✅ Secrets Manager — deployed
  ✅ ECS Fargate — 1/1 tasks running
  ✅ Bot Runner (Lambda + API Gateway) — deployed

Deployment Mode: Cloud API
  ℹ️  STT: Deepgram cloud API
  ℹ️  TTS: Cartesia cloud API

Secrets:
  ✅ DAILY_API_KEY — configured (42 chars)
  ✅ DEEPGRAM_API_KEY — configured (40 chars)
  ✅ CARTESIA_API_KEY — configured (38 chars)

Webhook:
  ✅ Endpoint responding — HTTP 200
  📍 URL: https://xxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/poc/start

Overall: ✅ All checks passed
```

### Phase 3: Diagnose Failures

For each failure, provide specific, actionable remediation:

**Missing SSM parameters:**
- "The [Stack Name] stack hasn't been deployed yet. Run `cd infrastructure && ./deploy.sh deploy-stack [StackName]`."

**ECS tasks not running:**
- "The voice agent container isn't running. Check the ECS console for task failure reasons. Common causes:"
  - "Container failed to pull from ECR — check IAM permissions"
  - "Container crashed on startup — check CloudWatch logs"
  - "Insufficient memory — the container needs 4GB minimum"

**Secrets missing:**
- "API keys haven't been configured. Run `cd infrastructure && ./scripts/init-secrets.sh` to set them up."
- If specifically DAILY_API_KEY is missing: "You need a Daily.co API key. Run the configure-daily skill to set up your phone number and API key."

**Webhook not responding:**
- "The Lambda function isn't responding. Check:"
  - "Lambda function exists in the AWS Console"
  - "API Gateway is deployed and has a stage"
  - "Lambda has VPC access to reach the ECS service"

**SageMaker endpoints not InService:**
- "Creating" → "SageMaker endpoints take 10-15 minutes to provision. Wait a few more minutes and check again."
- "Failed" → "Check CloudWatch logs at `/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/`. Common causes: wrong model package ARN, insufficient quota."

### Phase 4: Suggest Next Steps

Based on results:

- If all passing and no Daily phone: "Everything looks healthy! You just need a phone number. Use `/configure-daily` to set one up."
- If all passing with phone: "You're fully deployed! Call **[phone number]** to talk to your voice agent."
- If failures: "Let's fix these issues one at a time. I recommend starting with [most critical failure]."

**After core verification passes**, check for capability agents:

```bash
# Check if capability registry is enabled
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/config/enable-capability-registry" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-set"
```

Include a capability agent status section in the report:

```
Capability Agents:
  [status] Registry: enabled / disabled
  [status] KB Agent: deployed / not deployed
  [status] CRM Agent: deployed / not deployed
  [status] Appointment Agent: deployed / not deployed
```

To check whether agent stacks are deployed, look for their SSM parameters or CloudFormation stacks:
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name VoiceAgentKbAgent --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-deployed"
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name VoiceAgentCrmAgent --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-deployed"
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name VoiceAgentAppointmentAgent --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo "not-deployed"
```

If agents are not deployed, mention:
> "The Knowledge Base, CRM, and Appointment capability agents are optional. Use `/deploy-capability-agents` to add RAG search, customer lookup, or appointment scheduling to your voice agent."

"You can run this check anytime by asking me to verify the deployment."
