# Deploy — Cloud API Mode

You are guiding the user through deploying the voice agent using Deepgram and Cartesia cloud APIs. This is the simpler deployment path — no SageMaker, no GPU quotas, no Marketplace subscriptions.

## When This Skill Activates
- User wants to deploy the voice agent
- User asks about getting started
- User wants the simplest deployment path
- User mentions cloud APIs, Deepgram cloud, or Cartesia

## What To Do

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks

Run these checks and explain results conversationally:

1. **AWS credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
   - If succeeds: "You're connected to AWS account **[ID]** in region **[region]**. Is this the right account for your deployment?"
   - If fails (expired token, invalid credentials, or no credentials configured): list available AWS profiles and offer to use one:
     ```bash
     aws configure list-profiles
     ```
     - If profiles exist: show the list and ask the user which profile to use. Then authenticate with that profile:
       ```bash
       export AWS_PROFILE=<chosen-profile>
       aws sts get-caller-identity
       ```
       If `get-caller-identity` still fails (e.g. expired SSO session), prompt the user to refresh:
       ```bash
       aws sso login --profile <chosen-profile>
       ```
       Then retry `get-caller-identity`.
     - If no profiles exist: walk them through `aws configure` step by step to create one.
   - Once authenticated, confirm the account ID and region with the user.
   - **Wait for the user to confirm the account is correct before proceeding.**

2. **Node.js:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Require 18+.

3. **Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker --version 2>/dev/null || finch --version 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Either Docker or finch must be installed and running.

4. **Bedrock model access:**
   ```bash
   aws bedrock list-foundation-models --query "modelSummaries[?modelId=='anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0'].modelId" --output text --region us-east-1
   ```
   - If empty: "You need to enable Claude models in Bedrock. Go to the AWS Console → Amazon Bedrock → Model access → Request access to Anthropic Claude models. This is usually approved instantly."
   - **Don't proceed until Bedrock access is confirmed.**

Report all results in a summary:
```
Pre-flight check results:
✅ AWS credentials — Account 123456789012, us-east-1
✅ Node.js — v20.11.0
✅ Docker — Docker Desktop 4.28.0
✅ Bedrock — Claude models accessible
```

### Phase 2: Gather API Keys

Ask the user for three API keys. Explain what each service does in this project:

1. **Daily.co** — Phone/WebRTC platform that bridges calls to the voice agent. Key from [dashboard.daily.co](https://dashboard.daily.co) -> Developers -> API Keys.
2. **Deepgram** — Speech-to-text (caller's voice -> text for Claude). Key from [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com).
3. **Cartesia** — Text-to-speech (Claude's responses -> natural voice). Key from [play.cartesia.ai](https://play.cartesia.ai).

Confirm the user has all three keys before proceeding. They should not paste keys into chat — keys go into `.env` files and Secrets Manager.

### Phase 3: Configure Environment

```bash
cd infrastructure
cp .env.example .env
```

Only two values matter for cloud API mode:
- `ENVIRONMENT` — resource name prefix (default `poc` is fine)
- `AWS_REGION` — must have Bedrock Claude access (default `us-east-1`)

The Deepgram model package ARNs stay as placeholders in cloud API mode.

Show the user the final `.env` and confirm.

### Phase 4: Explain What Will Be Created

Before deploying, show what will be created:

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| VPC + NAT Gateway | Private networking |
| ECS Fargate (2 vCPU, 4GB) | Voice agent container |
| Network Load Balancer | Routes call requests |
| Secrets Manager + KMS | API key storage |
| Lambda + API Gateway | Webhook handler |
| CloudWatch Dashboard | Monitoring |

> **Cost responsibility:** The user is responsible for all AWS charges incurred by these resources. Remind them to use the **destroy-project** skill to tear down resources when done.

**Get explicit confirmation before deploying.** Show the account ID and region.

### Phase 5: Deploy Foundation + Configure Secrets + Deploy Remaining

Deploy in two stages so the ECS container picks up real API keys on first boot (no forced redeployment needed).

> **Critical: `USE_CLOUD_APIS=true`** — This environment variable **must** be set for every `cdk deploy` command in cloud API mode. It tells CDK to deploy a lightweight stub for the SageMaker stack (SSM parameters only) instead of provisioning real GPU endpoints. Without it, CDK deploys the real `SageMakerStack` which fails because the Deepgram Marketplace model package ARNs are placeholders. The failure rolls back but leaves the stack in `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state.

1. **Install and bootstrap:**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure && npm install
   ```
   Check if CDK is bootstrapped; if not, run `npx cdk bootstrap`.

2. **Set the cloud API mode flag** (must be set in every terminal session):
   ```bash
   export USE_CLOUD_APIS=true
   export CDK_DOCKER=finch  # or 'docker' if using Docker Desktop
   ```

3. **Deploy foundation stacks (Network + Storage):**
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentNetwork VoiceAgentStorage --require-approval never
   ```
   This creates the VPC and Secrets Manager. Takes ~3-5 minutes.

4. **Configure secrets now, before deploying ECS:**
   Write API keys to `backend/voice-agent/.env`, then push to Secrets Manager:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init-secrets.sh
   ```
   Verify secrets were stored:
   ```bash
   SECRET_ARN=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/storage/api-key-secret-arn" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text)
   aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "$SECRET_ARN" --query 'SecretString' --output text | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(f'{k}: {len(v)} chars') for k,v in json.loads(sys.stdin.read()).items() if v]"
   ```

5. **Deploy remaining stacks (SageMaker stub + ECS + BotRunner):**
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentSageMaker VoiceAgentEcs VoiceAgentBotRunner --require-approval never
   ```
   With `USE_CLOUD_APIS=true`, the `VoiceAgentSageMaker` stack deploys as a lightweight stub — it writes placeholder SSM parameters (`cloud-api-mode-stt-not-deployed` / `cloud-api-mode-tts-not-deployed`) that the ECS stack reads to set `STT_PROVIDER=deepgram` and `TTS_PROVIDER=cartesia`. No SageMaker endpoints or GPU resources are created. Takes ~8-10 minutes.

6. **Verify each phase succeeds** before proceeding. If any phase fails:
   - **SageMaker stack fails with "ModelPackage does not exist"**: You forgot `USE_CLOUD_APIS=true`. Set it and redeploy: `USE_CLOUD_APIS=true npx cdk deploy VoiceAgentSageMaker --require-approval never`
   - **Docker build timeout**: Container is large; ensure Docker has 4GB+ memory
   - **Access Denied**: IAM role needs administrator access
   - **ExpiredToken**: Re-authenticate and rerun; CDK resumes where it left off

### Phase 6: Show Progress and Next Steps

Fetch and display the webhook URL:
```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/voice-agent/botrunner/webhook-url" --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text
```

Show progress checklist:
```
Deployment Progress:
✅ Infrastructure deployed (Network, Storage, SageMaker, ECS, BotRunner)
✅ Secrets configured
🔲 Daily.co phone number — use /configure-daily
🔲 Verification — use /verify-deployment
🔲 Capability agents (optional) — use /deploy-capability-agents
```

Explain what is deployed and what is not yet:

> **What's running now:** The voice agent is live with Claude (Bedrock) for conversation and two built-in tools: `get_current_time` and `hangup_call`. Tool calling is enabled by default.
>
> **Not yet deployed:** The Knowledge Base and CRM capability agents are optional. After setting up your phone number and testing the basic agent, use `/deploy-capability-agents` to add them.

Remind user: use the **destroy-project** skill when done to release Daily phone numbers and tear down all AWS resources.
